FlashBuilder_AS3_Templates.xml
Contains a list of short cut AS3 commands to insert code quickly which I type far too often.
Type any of the following after import and press CTRL SPACE either once or twice for injection or intellisense.

newt //Sets up ttrace
tt //Use of ttrace
ss //Bulk code inject for standard stage setup
sing //Singleton design pattern function and variable
try // Minimal try catch
tween //Will give you a list of GreenSock tween code import options
darcey //Will give you a list of my code injections


FlashBuilder_File_Templates.xml
Contains templates for ActionScript files, I like to separate and keep my code readable and clean, so I divide each function with dash comments. To make this quicker and easier I put them in the AS class template.
